# Comments to Evaluators:
I added a constructor to the spreadsheet and a cell class. I did this because in the assignment details it advised to create a cell class. The constructor 
was advised to be created in piazza question @402. I created a helper method for all three SetCellContents that way it is easier to understand what is 
happening at each stage. I moved the header comment to the correct location (under the namespace and using) so please look there for my header comment.
I have also not created an extension class for my spreadsheet class as it was not specifically mentioned in the assignment.

# Assignment Specific Topics
