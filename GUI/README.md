# Comments to Evaluators:

# Assignment Specific Topics
We decided to make various design decisions. For example we decided to:
1. Added functionality to  type inside the cells themselves
2. Organized the spreadsheet to look more friendly to the user.
3. Added CSS styling to make
 In this file, you should keep track of design decisions, external code resources, build guidelines, implementation notes, problems, etc.

# Partnership Information
briefly describes the contributions of each member.  If all code was completed via pair programming, state as much.  
If each partner completed (some small) different sections of work, also indicated this (see Branching below). 

If your partnership was a success, write two paragraphs.  The first should list one or two examples where the partnership was 
most effective.  What did you do right and how did it make the coding process faster, and the code better? Include details on
how assigning tasks helped. The second paragraph should be about an area of teamwork that you need to improve upon.

# Branching

Detail any branches that were made so that each partner could work on separate functionality.  Describe the merge process and any 
challenges involved in it.  Make sure to list the commit numbers. 


# Consulted Peers:

List any peers (or other people) in the class (or outside for that matter) that you talked with about the project for more than one minute.
