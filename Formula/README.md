# Comments to Evaluators:
On the first line there is a warning SA1636 which is a style warning that came preloaded with the starter code. I was told on 
piazza (private question 158) to not worry about this style warning but to NOT delete it from my assignment
since it was given to us.

# Assignment Specific Topics
Assignment 2: In this assignment I learned a lot about regular expressions and their efficiency along with XML's and good
software practice.
Assignment 4: In this assignment I learned a lot about delegates and funcs and how powerful they can be. I was also able to 
learn more about good testing practices. I was also able to learn more about stacks in C#.
