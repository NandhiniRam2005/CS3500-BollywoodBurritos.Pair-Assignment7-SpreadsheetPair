# Comments to Evaluators:
I learned about the sequence equals from stack overflow. I learned that, that can be used to compare lists. I also wrote all my tests by hand and did 
not use ChatGPT even though the assignment instructions said that was an option. I chose not to use ChatGPT because I have heard that ChatGPT is an op
and not good for asking for code. I moved the header comment to the correct location (under the namespace and using) so please look there for my header comment.
I also only have one basic test for the constructor that is because all the other tests double as tests for the constructor.
In accordance with what was said in class we are allowed to keep auto grader tests which I did. 

# Assignment Specific Topics
Assignment 5: In the spreadsheet tests class I will learn more about Test Driven development. Learn to utilize/combine the appropriate 
existing functionality to generate a more powerful combination. Continue practicing comprehensive and deep reading of complex
requirements and specifications. Continue to utilize fundamental programming concepts such as recursion. Continue to practice
test driven development and achieving full code coverage from tests. Starting to understand the utility of the Model-View-Controller architecture
Assignment 6: We are to learn and practice using Serialization (via reflection) to save and restore data .Understanding more about
regression testing and updating tests to meet new APIs/requirements. Understanding how to draw useful sketches to represent system 
architectures. We will also continue to practice test driven development.
